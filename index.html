                <hr/>

                <p>   My mission is to give, for giving is what I do best and I can learn to do better. <br/><br/>
                    <img src="images/mission.jpg" height="250" width="750"/>
                    I will seek to learn, for learning is the basis for growth, and growing is the key to living. I will seek first to understand, for understanding is the key to finding value, and value is the basis for respect, decisions, and action. This should be my first act with my wife, my family, and my business. <br/><br/>
                    I want to help influence the future development of people and organizations. I want to teach my children and others to love and laugh, to learn and grow beyond their current bounds. <br/>
                    I will build personal, business, and civic relationships by giving, in frequent little ways.</p>

                <hr/>
                <hr/>

                <img src="images\vision.jpg"  height="250" width="750"/>
                <p>I would like to share with you my life plan and how to create a vision, purpose & goals for your life. <br/><br/>

                    I am a firm believer that if you aren’t growing, you’re dying. <br/><br/>

                    At the end of your life, what matters most is not what you acquired, but who you became. <br/><br/>

                    Having a vision is what makes life more exciting and worthwhile.  What is it that makes you get out of bed every morning? <br/><br/>

                    If you don’t have a plan for your life, you will be a part of someone else’s plan. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In the words of Jim Rohn, “If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.”</p>

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h1 align="center">My Goals for Life</h1>
                <hr/>
                <hr/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <img src="images/lg.jpg"  height="250" width="750"/>
                I spend a lot of time writing about goals. But I realize I haven’t shared many of my own. Although I wouldn’t consider my dreams to be unique, <br/I don’t know too many people that share them. Most of my friends are caught up in the mythology that you need to get a good job,<br/> settle down and chain yourself to a retirement package for the rest of your life.<br/>
                <p> I have two different types of goals. <br/>

                    1st as a professional, being an employee of a software company. <br/>

                    I Want to work with my all efforts and hard work by which company can grow. Along with that, I want to learn new things and enhance my skills. I strongly believe on myself, so I will do my best.<br/>

                    I want promotion as soon as possible and also a good position. <br/>

                    It will happen if I will do my best. <br/>

                    2nd as a passion, my hobby is making video i am a professinal video maketer. i will make my hobby as a part time income that suppport me as a long time thats also my long tarm goal.<br/>
                    i want work daily 2  hour as a video marketer. i hope  everyone pray for me. i want to full fill my target.<br/>

                    Thanks.</p>
